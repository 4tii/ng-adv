# Food App Project - Lab 2

## Tasks

- Refactor the filter in the food list to use a FormControl and a Data- and Action Stream.

- Use a responsive mat-sidenav-container to enable toggle the left nav. Implement the toggle functionality in an stateful `menu.service.ts` using a BehaviourSubject. You can refactor this to use ngrx later on.
